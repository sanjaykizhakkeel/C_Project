Library Management System
This is a simple command-line-based Library Management System written in C.
It allows users to manage a collection of books by displaying available books, adding new books, borrowing books, and exiting the program.
The program uses dynamic memory allocation to store book data and provides a basic menu-driven interface.

Features
Display Available Books: Shows a list of all books currently available in the library.
Add New Book: Allows the user to add one or more books to the library by specifying their names.
Borrow Book: Enables the user to borrow a book by entering its name, removing it from the library's list.
Exit: Terminates the program and frees allocated memory.

How It Works
The program uses a struct library (typedef'd as lib) to store book names as character arrays.
A dynamic array of lib structures is maintained using malloc and realloc to handle a variable number of books.
The main loop presents a menu with four options, and the user interacts with the system by entering numbers and text input.
Memory is managed manually, with free called before exiting to prevent memory leaks.

Functions
display(lib* data, int n): Displays all available books or a message if the library is empty.
add(lib** data, int* n): Adds new books by resizing the dynamic array and taking user input for book names.
borrow(lib* data, int* n): Searches for a book by name, removes it from the list if found, and adjusts the array.
end(): Prints an exit message when the user chooses to leave the program.
